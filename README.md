# Quantum Darwinism Tutorial using Qiskit

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook tutorial exploring **Quantum Darwinism** through simulation with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).  
The tutorial covers:

- Constructing system-environment initial states with density matrices  
- Generating random broadcasting Hamiltonians  
- Evolving joint system-environment states using Hamiltonian dynamics  
- Calculating and plotting Partial Information Plots (PIPs) 
- Generating and analyzing Spectrum Broadcast Structure (SBS) states
